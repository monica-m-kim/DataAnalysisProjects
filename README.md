### 1.DataMining_Fall2020
This final project was done for Data Mining course (Fall 2020) at the University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business.
The data used in the project was retrieved from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/clementmsika/mubi-sqlite-database-for-movie-lovers)
As a member of a team consisted of three people, I have taken the responsibility to analyze data and build models. The final presentation and paper were finished as a team. Python packages, websites, and data file used for building models and writing the final paper are all listed in the reference list within the paper.

### 2.Python_Fall2019
This was a final project for Programming with Python course (Fall 2019) at the University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business.
The data used in the project was retrieved from World Values Survey(http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp)
The goal of the project was to create a five-minute presentation video with insights from examining the WVS dataset. Details of my project's goal can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. 
As a newbie Python learner with 3 months of learning python, this was my first data analysis project and it was challenging. I referred and incorporated numerous code snippets provided by my professor but the project purpose and the analysis was entirely done by myself.
Looking back, I see analytical errors so I was reluctant to post this. However, as this proves that my skills have been developing over the year, I decided to upload this as well.

### 3.GreatBritishBakeOff (Ongoing)
Do you like baking? I love baking! I binge-watched the Great British Baking Show (this is a US version name due to Pillsbury's trademark 'Bake Off') after graduation, starting from Season 11 and going backwards. While watching the show and baking loaves of bread, pies, and so many things, Paul Hollywood's comment about 'Star Baker in Bread Week always go through the final' struck my mind. I decided to make this my toy project and work on predicting a series winner. I used a data from https://github.com/apreshill/bakeoff/blob/master/data-raw/baker_results.csv and since the csv file is lacking season 9, 10, 11 data, I filled in the data manually based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off. This is an ongoing project so I will be updating the Jupyter Notebook periodically.

Aside of predicting a series winner, I am curious about the flavor combination used by the bakers. Since the baking is judged by two people, there might be a preferred flavor combination by those two(or not!) There was no data available for what flavors and ingredients are used in signature and showstopper bakes, therefore, I went through all episodes of season 8 to 11 and wrote down the mentioned or visible ingredients. I haven't started analyzing data but I am sharing the data set for those who are interested in using it. I am planning to add more season data. Oh, and let me know if you find typos!
