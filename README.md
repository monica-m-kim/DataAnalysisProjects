### DataMining_Fall2020
This final project was done for Data Mining course (Fall 2020) at the University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business.
The data used in the project was retrieved from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/clementmsika/mubi-sqlite-database-for-movie-lovers)
As a member of a team consisted of three people, I have taken the responsibility to analyze data and build models. The final presentation and paper were finished as a team. Python packages, websites, and data file used for building models and writing the final paper are all listed in the reference list within the paper.

### Python_Fall2019
This was a final project for Programming with Python course (Fall 2019) at the University of Pittsburgh, Katz Graduate School of Business.
The data used in the project was retrieved from World Values Survey(http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp)
The goal of the project was to create a five-minute presentation video with insights from examining the WVS dataset. Details of my project's goal can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. 
As a newbie Python learner with 3 months of learning python, this was my first data analysis project and it was challenging. I referred and incorporated numerous code snippets provided by my professor but the project purpose and the analysis was entirely done by myself.
Looking back, I see analytical errors so I was reluctant to post this. However, as this proves that my skills have been developing over the year, I decided to upload this as well.
